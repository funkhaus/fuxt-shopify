# ASSETS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript. Anything in this directory will be added to your bundle by Webpack.

You should put small file size images in here.

Any SVG's in `assets/svg` can be used like `<svg-file-name/>` in your templates.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#webpacked).
